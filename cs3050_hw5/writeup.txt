Write Up


I believe my degree of success with this project is 8.5/10. 
I believe this because my program is printing out unintended results. But the idea is correct.

First step was to finish the “Addinput function”, adding the two binary functions. Binum1 and binum2.
This giving us the sum in binary value. This will call the convert function. 

Then I created a covert function. The idea of this function was two take the binary number and convert into charters that that can be outputted. 
To do this, I went to the address  of the sum, then using the div function, took eat digit and converted it, by adding 48 and pushing in on to the stack.

Then I created two print functions. A normal print function and a print function for my sum.
The sum took eat ASCI digit on the sum and print it out onto the screen. The next will print out normal strings.

Also lastly made an overload function which printed out the overload string and halted.

I do not deserve full credit because I believe my covert fun	tion or printsum function is holding garbage values or its not cleaning up the stack correctly. asl

cnvert: lodd biansw:
jzer cvtFin:
div 10
addd numoff:
push
lodd count:
addd c1:
stod count:
call cnvert:

Also can be that im not understanding the div function. I believe its supposed to div and leave remainder in AC. If that is not correct then that is the reason why my program is not working as intended.
